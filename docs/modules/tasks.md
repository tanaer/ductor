# tasks/

Delegated background task system (`TaskHub`) for long-running autonomous work.

## Files

- `tasks/hub.py`: task lifecycle (submit/run/resume/question/cancel/shutdown)
- `tasks/registry.py`: persistent registry + task-folder seeding + cleanup/delete
- `tasks/models.py`: `TaskSubmit`, `TaskEntry`, `TaskInFlight`, `TaskProgress`, `TaskResult`
- `orchestrator/selectors/task_selector.py`: `/tasks` UI callbacks (`tsc:*`)
- `_home_defaults/workspace/tools/task_tools/*.py`: CLI tools (`create`, `resume`, `ask_parent`, `list`, `cancel`, `delete`)

## Purpose

Run long work asynchronously while keeping parent chat responsive.

High-level flow:

1. create (`/tasks/create`)
2. emit `running`, then execute (`TaskHub._run`)
3. optional question (`/tasks/ask_parent`)
4. optional resume (`/tasks/resume`)
5. emit `reviewing`, then perform result delivery + parent-session injection
6. optional permanent deletion (`/tasks/delete`)

## Persistence and folders

Main-home task data:

- registry: `~/.ductor/tasks.json`
- folders: `~/.ductor/workspace/tasks/<task_id>/`

Task folder seeds include:

- `TASKMEMORY.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`

Startup/maintenance behavior:

- stale `running` entries -> downgraded to `failed`
- orphan entries/folders are cleaned
- maintenance (orphan cleanup + finished-task retention pruning via `tasks.finished_retention_hours` / `tasks.finished_keep_last`) runs immediately at startup, then every 5 hours

## Config (`AgentConfig.tasks`)

- `enabled`
- `progress_updates` (default `true`)
- `progress_interval_seconds` (default `30.0`, minimum `10.0`)
- `max_parallel` (per chat)
- `timeout_seconds`

## Telegram lifecycle status

Telegram keeps one status message per `(chat_id, topic_id, task_id)` and edits it on the
configured interval. The timer continues through the parent model's result review, then the
same message becomes completed, failed, cancelled, waiting, or timed out. Task prompts, tool
arguments, and model reasoning are never used as progress text. Matrix and Slack retain their
existing terminal-result behavior.

## Execution model (`TaskHub`)

`submit(TaskSubmit)`:

- resolves chat ID from `parent_agent` mapping when missing
- creates registry entry and folder
- appends mandatory task rules suffix
- normalizes `priority` to `interactive|background|batch`
- enforces `max_parallel` only for non-`interactive` tasks
- spawns async execution

`_run(...)`:

- builds `AgentRequest` with `process_label=task:<task_id>`
- applies provider/model overrides when supplied
- persists resolved provider/model on first run
- updates status:
  - `done`
  - `waiting` (question asked)
  - `failed`
  - `cancelled`

Resume behavior:

- allowed from `done|failed|cancelled|waiting`
- requires stored `session_id` and provider
- keeps same `task_id` and folder

Cancellation behavior:

- `TaskHub.cancel()` and `cancel_all()` kill the registered subprocess tree first via `ProcessRegistry.kill_for_task(task_id)`
- only after the subprocess is gone is the asyncio task cancelled, which avoids hanging streaming pipes

## Topic-aware routing

Tasks preserve topic context:

- `TaskEntry.thread_id` stores origin topic/thread
- `create_task.py` forwards `DUCTOR_CHAT_ID` and `DUCTOR_TOPIC_ID` to `/tasks/create`
- result/question envelopes map `thread_id -> topic_id`
- parent-session injection resumes the correct topic session

## InternalAgentAPI endpoints

- `POST /tasks/create`
- `POST /tasks/resume`
- `POST /tasks/ask_parent`
- `GET /tasks/list`
- `POST /tasks/cancel`
- `POST /tasks/delete`

Behavior details:

- no task hub attached -> `503` for mutating endpoints (`/tasks/list` returns empty list)
- `/tasks/list?from=<agent>` filters by task owner
- ownership checks for `/tasks/resume`, `/tasks/cancel`, `/tasks/delete` when `from` is provided
- `/tasks/delete` only deletes finished tasks (`done|failed|cancelled`)
- `/tasks/create` accepts `priority`; unknown values coerce to `background`

## Registry deletion semantics

`TaskRegistry.delete(task_id)`:

- returns `False` if task is missing or not in a finished state
- removes both registry entry and task folder
- resolves folder path before entry removal (prevents per-agent folder resolution bug)

Bulk cleanup path:

- `cleanup_finished(chat_id=None)` removes all finished tasks

## Telegram UX (`/tasks`)

`/tasks` is quick-command routed and renders selector UI:

- sections: Running, Waiting for answer, Finished
- callbacks (`tsc:*`): refresh, cancel one, cancel all, delete finished
- if disabled: `Task system is not enabled.`

## Tool scripts

From task agent context:

- `create_task.py`
- `resume_task.py`
- `ask_parent.py`
- `list_tasks.py`
- `cancel_task.py`
- `delete_task.py`

`create_task.py` supports `--priority interactive|background|batch`.

`delete_task.py TASK_ID` performs permanent removal of one finished task via `/tasks/delete`.
